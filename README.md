## MiSideDietDiary

MiSideDietDiary is a simple MiSide themed diet diary app made in Unreal. It is designed to be minimal, clear, and satisfying to use.

The app lets you record your daily meals and their calories, with separate sections for meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Your progress is saved automatically, and a new date entry is added each day as you continue using it. Over time your diary fills up naturally, making it easy to track your consistency and habits.

MiSideDietDiary also calculates your total calories for the day and your weekly average calories consumed.

MiSideDietDiary is completely free and open source. This project is not affiliated with the game MiSide, it is simply a small fan project made for fun.
